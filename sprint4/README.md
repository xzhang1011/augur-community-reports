# Sprint 4 Report
- Final version of repository found in forked augur community reports: 
  - Run sprint4.ipynb and finalSprint.ipynb
  - sprint4.ipynb features code change count/week and lines of code added/week with hover tool and tabs
    -  Could not connect to augur database so used hardcoded values found in excel
    -  Had trouble grouping data together so visualization is scattered
  -  finalSprint.ipynb features contributor template with added hover tool and line graph visualization
-  Had trouble figuring out how to connect to augur database and process data using python
