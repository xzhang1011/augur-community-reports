- Added files practiceSprint3.ipynb and sprint3.ipynb
- Actual augur visualizations will be in sprint3.ipynb but had trouble figuring out how to display data from database so used practiceSprint3.ipynb to show the graph that I'd like to display using Augur data once I figure out what I'm doing
- Next Steps: use augur data for visualizations
